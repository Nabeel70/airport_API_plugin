# Client Communication: Air Du Cap API Access Issue

## Issue Summary
Your WordPress plugin has been successfully developed and tested, but we've discovered that the **Production API endpoints are returning 404 errors**, while the **UAT environment works perfectly**.

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ **Plugin functionality**: Complete and working
- ✅ **Airport search**: Working with UAT API
- ✅ **Flight search**: Working with UAT API  
- ✅ **UI/UX**: Matches your website design
- ✅ **Responsive design**: Works on all devices
- ✅ **Integration**: Ready for WordPress

## API Environment Issue ❌
- ❌ **Production API**: `https://book.airducap.com` returns 404 errors
- ✅ **UAT API**: `https://uat-book.airducap.com` works correctly

## What We've Tested

### Working UAT Environment
```
URL: https://uat-book.airducap.com
Status: ✅ 200 OK
Sample Response: Beechcraft Baron 58, R31,443, 170 knots
```

### Broken Production Environment
```
URL: https://book.airducap.com  
Status: ❌ 404 Not Found
Error: "The requested resource was not found on this server"
```

## Questions for You

To complete the integration, we need clarification on:

### 1. Production API Access
- What are the correct Production API endpoints?
- Has the API URL structure changed recently?
- Are there different authentication requirements for Production?

### 2. Environment Strategy
- Should the plugin use UAT or Production data?
- Is the UAT aircraft fleet representative of your Production offering?
- Are there any restrictions on using UAT for the live plugin?

### 3. Data Expectations
- Should the plugin show the same aircraft as your main website?
- Are there pricing differences between UAT and Production?
- Do you prefer Production data accuracy or UAT stability?

## Temporary Solution

**The plugin is currently configured to use UAT environment** to ensure functionality while we resolve the Production API access.

### Current Configuration:
```php
API URL: https://uat-book.airducap.com (Working)
Authentication: Basic Auth with provided credentials
Status: Fully functional
```

### When Production Access is Available:
```php
API URL: [To be provided by client]
Authentication: [To be confirmed by client]  
Status: Ready to switch
```

## Next Steps

### Option A: Use UAT Environment (Immediate)
- ✅ Plugin works immediately
- ✅ All functionality available  
- ❌ Limited to UAT aircraft fleet
- ❌ Test data instead of production data

### Option B: Get Production Access (Recommended)
- ✅ Real aircraft fleet data
- ✅ Production pricing
- ✅ Matches your website exactly
- ⏳ Requires API access information from you

## Files Available for Review

We've created comprehensive testing documentation:

1. **`AirDuCap-API-Postman-Collection.json`** - Complete API testing suite
2. **`API-Testing-Guide.md`** - Step-by-step testing instructions  
3. **`API-Analysis-Results.md`** - Detailed analysis of the API differences
4. **`test-api-endpoints.sh`** - Quick command-line testing script

## Plugin Ready for Deployment

The plugin is **100% complete and ready** for your WordPress site. It just needs clarification on which API environment to use for the best user experience.

**Would you prefer to:**
1. **Deploy with UAT data** for immediate availability?
2. **Wait for Production API access** for complete data accuracy?
3. **Provide Production API details** for us to configure?

The choice depends on whether UAT aircraft selection meets your business requirements or if you need the full Production fleet.
